## Description
For this project we used cypress UI automation in which we used Page Object Frame work to validate the ReadMore Link for the QA role in careers page from Dave.com.
 
Installing cypress:
cd /your/project/path
npm init -y
npm i cypress

For running the test in local machine from project directory
npx cypress run
For running each spec in head mode
npx cypress open

For Running CI Pipeline with Git Lab:

For Intializing Git Repository
$git init

To add remote connection
$git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/cypress21/cypress-dave.git
$git branch -M main
$git pull origin main
$git push -uf origin main

To validate the connection
$git remote -v

$git status
$git add .
$git commit -m "COMMENT"
$git push -uf origin main
